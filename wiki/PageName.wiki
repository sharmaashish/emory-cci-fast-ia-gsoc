===Possible reasons of poor performance for OpenCL implementation using CPU===
 * Using local queues per work-item and moving them to higher level queue using prefix sum is probably a substantial reason. On CPU architectures every work-group is executed by single thread, from beginning to the end. It cause that there is no concurrency between work-times in work-group. For CPU version, local per-work-item queues should be replaced by per-work-group queues. Each work-item could add data to local queue by simply increasing shared index.
 * OpenCL version was tested using AMD's Ocl implementations on Intel CPU. I may cause that code is not the best optimized.

=== Possible solutions ===
 * Separate MR Ocl implementation for gpu and cpu version.



== Test data ==

Data used are located in test_data directory on svn repositry.

The last part of the marker file name ('eroded_Nx') means how many times
erosion was performed on original image (mask).
